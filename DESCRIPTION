Description: A differential expression analysis method for RNA-seq data from repeated-measures design 
    using general linear model framework and parametric bootstrap inference. The method accounts for 
    the dependence of gene expression levels due to the repeated-measures through continuous autoregressive 
    correlation structure. The method is described in Chapter 4 of 
    Nguyen (2018) <https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7433&context=etd>.
